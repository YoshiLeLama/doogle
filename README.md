# Doogle

It's like Google but dumber (or smarter depending on your opinion on Google). The current project structure is very inspired by [Tsoding's seroost](https://github.com/tsoding/seroost).

Currently uses a predetermined directory for indexing (not included in this repo but it's [this thing](https://github.com/BSVino/docs.gl)) but it'll change soon soon soon.

I plan to make it multithreaded to speed up indexing and querying.
